# 🛡️ M1S0 – Security Research 👾

---

## 👤 About Me  
I am **M1S0**, a security researcher with a strong foundation in both **Web2 application security** and **Web3 blockchain security**. My journey started with bug bounty programs where I gained extensive experience in identifying and reporting issues across web applications and APIs. Over time, I expanded into Web3, focusing on smart contract auditing, dApp testing, and blockchain-specific attack surfaces. I bring a mix of manual analysis, fuzzing, invariant testing, and exploit proof-of-concepts to validate real-world risks. Combining traditional penetration testing methodologies with modern Web3 security practices, my goal is to deliver impactful findings, help secure ecosystems, and continuously grow as both a hacker and auditor.
